# Thanksgiving Dinner Analysis

In this first python based project I will analyzing data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US. . I will primarily be using Python and the Pandas libraty to preform aalysis with. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight.

The dataset is stored in the thanksgiving.csv file. It contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.

The dataset has 65 columns, and 1058 rows. Most of the column names are questions, and most of the column values are string responses to the questions. Most of the columns are categorical, as a survey respondent had to select one of a few options. For example, one of the first column names is What is typically the main dish at your Thanksgiving dinner?. The potential responses are:

Turkey
Other (please specify)
Ham/Pork
Tofurkey
Chicken
Roast beef
I don't know
Turducken
Most of the columns follow the same question/response format as the above. There are also quite a few NaN values in the columns, which occurred when a survey respondent didn't fill out a question because they didn't want to, or it didn't apply to them.

Here are the first few rows of the dataset:


```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("thanksgiving.csv", encoding="Latin-1",)
data.head(5)

### Findings
It appears that more people with high income have Thanksgiving at home than people with low income. This may be because younger students, who don't have a high income, tend to go home, whereas parents, who have higher incomes, don't.

## Linking Friendship And Age

There are two columns which directly pertain to friendship, Have you ever tried to meet up with hometown friends on Thanksgiving night?, and Have you ever attended a "Friendsgiving?. In the US, a "Friendsgiving" is when instead of traveling home for the holiday, you celebrate it with friends who live in your area. Both questions seem skewed towards younger people. Let's see if this hypothesis holds up.


```python
data.pivot_table(
    index="Have you ever tried to meet up with hometown friends on Thanksgiving night?", 
    columns='Have you ever attended a "Friendsgiving?"',
    values="int_age"
)
```




<div>
<style>
    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th {
        text-align: right;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: left;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>Have you ever attended a "Friendsgiving?"</th>
      <th>No</th>
      <th>Yes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Have you ever tried to meet up with hometown friends on Thanksgiving night?</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>No</th>
      <td>42.283702</td>
      <td>37.010526</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Yes</th>
      <td>41.475410</td>
      <td>33.976744</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



### Findings
Hypothesis seems to hold true here as the data suggests the average age for somone attending Frendsgiving and visting hometown friends during thanksgiving is the lowest

## Linking Friendship and Income
Younger people tend to be in the lower income bracket. If the above correlation between age and Freindsgiving is accurate, then the correlation between income and Friendsgiving should confirm the hypothesis.


```python
data.pivot_table(
    index="Have you ever tried to meet up with hometown friends on Thanksgiving night?", 
    columns='Have you ever attended a "Friendsgiving?"',
    values="int_income"
)
```




<div>
<style>
    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th {
        text-align: right;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: left;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>Have you ever attended a "Friendsgiving?"</th>
      <th>No</th>
      <th>Yes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Have you ever tried to meet up with hometown friends on Thanksgiving night?</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>No</th>
      <td>78914.549654</td>
      <td>72894.736842</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Yes</th>
      <td>78750.000000</td>
      <td>66019.736842</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



### Findings
Hypothesis seems to hold true here, folks in the lower income bracket seem to visit friends on Thanksgiving versus the higher income bracket.
